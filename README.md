# WeatherApp
Weather App implementation using OpenWeatherMap API. The programming languages used for this 
project will be C++ and Python.

C++ will be used for the development of the backend. That is: connection to the API and retrive 
data from there. 

Python will be used for testing and presenting the report on a GUI made with Tkinter.

The OpenWeatherMap API gives the next example of JSON file as response: 
https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-3#start

Functionallity:
- Application calls OpenWeather API and takes current actual data from any location.
- A report is written with actual weather in the specified location
- This report appears on a screen

Next Steps:
- README will be updated with the steps for running the application and neccesary dependencies
